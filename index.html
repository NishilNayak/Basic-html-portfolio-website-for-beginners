                <p><em>On a journey of acquiring new knowlage and exploring places</em></p>
                <p>I am a student at <a href="https://paruluniversity.ac.in/"> parul university </a> currently enrolled in <a href="https://paruluniversity.ac.in/course/bachelor-of-computer-application"> BCA </a> .I love to read books especially fiction .My favourite writers are Hruki Murakami and Fyodor Dostoevsky . I have been reading for 4 years now amd i find it quite exciting that someone can convey a story which was bron from his/her mind to a huge mass of people through a book it is so fasinating . I also love to play guitar and sing . Music is my stressbuster (I guess its everyones stressbuster not only mine). recently i have started learning web development and this is my first portfolio website  I know it does not have any fancy animations and colours but I am making this one to understand basic html concepts so I  think that its fine if it does not have css and javascript as i dont know css and java script as of today . this website does look like a very old website tho like the way websites used to be in the old times .   </p>
